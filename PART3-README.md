Part 3 summary:
- Added advanced leaderboards (Redis support) utility
- Built server chat controller that constrains OpenAI to food-only answers and stores chat history for 30 days
- Provided Dockerfile + render.yaml + CI workflow
- Added hardware integration docs for micro:bit, Arduino & transistor/LED guidance
- UI polish and accessibility guidance
- Seed script to create demo user for quick local testing

Next steps:
1) Add environment variables to .env
2) Run seed script (if using lowdb): node server/scripts/seed-demo.js
3) Rebuild client: cd client && npm ci && npm run build
4) Start server: node server.js (or npm start depending on your project)
5) Test chat: create user -> POST /api/chat with Authorization Bearer token

If you'd like, I can:
- generate Docker Compose to run Redis + Mongo + app locally
- create sample mobile code that connects to micro:bit via Web Bluetooth (demo)
- create animated UI assets (SVGs) for spinner and leaderboards

Say which of the above you'd like next and I will generate it immediately.
