Accessibility quick checklist (run this before final deployment):
- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) have text labels and keyboard focus.
- Images must have alt attributes.
- Color contrast for body text must be at least 4.5:1 against background.
- Ensure forms have label elements.
- Test with keyboard only (Tab navigation).
