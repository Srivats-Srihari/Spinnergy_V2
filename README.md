# Spinnergy (Part 1 scaffold)

This folder was generated by `generate-part1.js`.

What this part includes:
- Single-service server (server.js) that serves API endpoints and static client from `/public`
- A client skeleton (React) with improved UI CSS
- Build & copy helper scripts for Windows (PowerShell) and Unix (bash)
- .env.example (fill values before running)

Run locally:
1. cd spinnergy
2. npm install
3. npm run build-client    # builds client
4. npm run build-and-copy  # builds client and copies build into server/public
5. npm start               # starts server (serves static files and APIs)

This is PART 1. Run PART 2 and PART 3 generators to add the rest of the features.
